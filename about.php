<pre>A magazine is a publication, usually a periodical publication, which is printed or electronically
published(sometimes referred to as an online magazine). Magazines are generally published on a regular 
schedule and contain a variety of content. They are generally financed by advertising, by a purchase price,by 
prepaid subscriptions, or a combination of the three. At its root the word "magazine" refers to a collection or 
storage location. In the case of written publication, it is a collection of written articles. This explains why magazine 
publications share the word root with sports magazine.</pre>
